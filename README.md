def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
This part of the code defines a function called factorial that takes an integer n as input and returns the factorial of n. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The function is implemented recursively. If n is 0, it returns 1 (as 0! equals 1). Otherwise, it recursively calculates the factorial by multiplying n with the factorial of n-1.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))
    print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
This part of the code is executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module). It prompts the user to input a number, converts the input to an integer, calculates its factorial using the factorial function defined earlier, and then prints the result.

So, when you run this script, it will ask you to enter a number, and then it will calculate and print the factorial of that number.

Overall, this code demonstrates a simple example of using functions and recursion in Python to calculate the factorial of a number.
